# NextWord-Predictor-ML-MLOps-Django

Welcome to the NextWord-Predictor-ML-MLOps-Django repository! This project combines Machine Learning (ML), MLOps, and the Django framework to create an advanced next word prediction system.

## Description

The NextWord-Predictor-ML-MLOps-Django project aims to accurately predict the next word based on a given input text. It utilizes state-of-the-art ML techniques trained on a corpus to analyze patterns and make accurate predictions. The project integrates MLOps practices to streamline the ML pipeline, ensuring efficient deployment and monitoring of the ML model. The Django framework is used to build a user-friendly web interface for easy interaction with the prediction system.

## Features

- ML-based next word prediction using advanced algorithms
- Seamless integration with MLOps for efficient ML model deployment and monitoring
- Web interface built with Django for user-friendly interaction
- Easily customizable and extendable codebase
